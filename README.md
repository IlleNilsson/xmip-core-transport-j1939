# xmip-core-transport-j1939

J1939 transport: SAE J1939 over CAN — 29-bit identifiers of priority, parameter group and source address, and the transport protocol, BAM and RTS/CTS, for a payload of up to 1785 bytes. A technology of [xmip-core-transport](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport).

A send target is read by `net::Target` in [xmip-core-library-net](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-library-net), the one reading of a URI every technology calls, and its query is decoded there. Until 2026-09-28 this technology split the query off itself, without percent-decoding it.

A `0x` number in a target is read by `codec::hex::prefixed_number` in [xmip-core-library-codec](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-library-codec), which refuses a sign; until 2026-09-28 it was read with `from_str_radix`, which took `0x+7e8`.

## Toolchain
